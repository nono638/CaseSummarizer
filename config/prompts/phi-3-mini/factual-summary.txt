IMPORTANT: You are reviewing MULTIPLE legal documents from the SAME case. Synthesize them into ONE comprehensive summary.

TARGET: {max_words} words ({min_words} to {max_words_range} word range)

DOCUMENT SYNTHESIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read ALL documents together as ONE case file
2. Extract the core case information: parties, claims, damages, procedures, timeline, defendants' responses
3. Create ONE flowing narrative that integrates information from all documents
4. Do NOT analyze or summarize documents individually
5. Do NOT repeat information - mention each fact once
6. Do NOT use document titles or headers in your output

CASE FACTS TO CAPTURE:
- Plaintiff name(s) and defendant name(s)
- What happened (factual events, injuries, procedures, medical treatment)
- When it happened (dates, timeline)
- Where it happened (locations)
- Damage amounts (monetary claims, medical expenses, lost wages)
- Procedural status (what stage the case is in)
- Defendant's position/response to allegations

TONE & STYLE:
- Clear, plain English suitable for a court record
- Objective facts only - no legal analysis, speculation, or interpretation
- Active voice preferred ("The plaintiff underwent surgery" not "Surgery was undergone")
- Chronological order when possible
- NO meta-commentary like "The document states..." or "According to..."

CASE DOCUMENTS (synthesize these into one summary):
---
{case_text}

Now write the case summary:
