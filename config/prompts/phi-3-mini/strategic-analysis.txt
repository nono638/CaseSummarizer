Multiple legal documents are provided below (each marked with a document header). Analyze them as a unified case to provide strategic insights with these requirements:

WORD COUNT: Between {min_words} and {max_words_range} words (target: {max_words} words)

SYNTHESIS & ANALYTICAL FOCUS:
- Synthesize information across ALL documents to understand the complete case narrative
- Identify contradictions or inconsistencies within and across documents
- Note what is conspicuously absent or not mentioned in any document (missing evidence, avoided topics)
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each party's overall position based on all documents
- Flag ambiguities, unusual procedural moves, or strategic choices across the case timeline
- Consider strategic implications for litigation or settlement based on the full picture
- Look for patterns, themes, or underlying issues that emerge when viewing all documents together
- Note how different documents support, contradict, or supplement each other

OUTPUT STYLE:
- Write in analytical, professional language appropriate for a court reporter
- Use critical thinking and inference while staying grounded in the documents
- Employ affirmative statements about what you observe
- Organize insights by importance or strategic impact
- Clearly distinguish between explicit facts and your analytical observations
- Do NOT include labels, headers, document titles, or meta-commentary in your response
- Do NOT analyze documents individually - provide a unified strategic analysis
