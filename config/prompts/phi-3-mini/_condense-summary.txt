The following legal case summary is TOO LONG. Condense it to approximately {max_words} words (target range: {min_words} to {max_words_range} words).

CONDENSATION RULES:
1. Preserve ALL key facts: parties, claims, damages, dates, procedural status
2. Remove redundant or repetitive information
3. Combine related sentences where possible
4. Use more concise phrasing without losing meaning
5. Keep the same objective tone and chronological structure
6. Do NOT add new information or interpretation
7. Do NOT use meta-commentary like "This summary describes..."

ORIGINAL SUMMARY TO CONDENSE:
---
{case_text}
---

Now write the condensed summary in {max_words} words or fewer:
