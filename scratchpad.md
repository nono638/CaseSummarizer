# Scratchpad - Future Ideas & Refinements

## Ideas for Future Phases

### Performance Optimization Ideas
- Multi-threaded OCR processing for large documents
- Caching mechanism for frequently processed documents
- GPU acceleration option for AI model inference (if user has compatible GPU)

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Dark mode theme
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Preview pane showing original document side-by-side with cleaned text

### Advanced Features (Post-v1.0)
- Batch processing mode (process multiple cases overnight)
- Template system for custom summary formats
- Integration with court reporter workflow tools
- Export to Word/PDF with formatting
- Compare mode (diff between versions of documents)

### Quality Improvements
- Unit test coverage for all modules
- Integration tests with sample legal documents
- Benchmark suite for performance testing
- Automated UI testing with pytest-qt

### Documentation
- User manual with screenshots
- Video tutorials for common workflows
- Troubleshooting guide
- Developer documentation for extending the application

## Questions to Address Later
- Should we support other file formats (DOCX, ODT)?
- What's the best way to handle multi-language documents?
- Should we add a "confidence threshold" setting that auto-rejects low-quality OCR?
- Would users benefit from a "quick summary" mode (shorter processing time, less detail)?

## Technical Debt to Monitor
- None yet - project just starting
