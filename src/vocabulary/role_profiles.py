Role Detection Profiles for Vocabulary Extraction

This module provides profession-specific role/relevance detection for the
vocabulary extractor. Different professions need different contextual information:

- Stenographers: Party roles (plaintiff, defendant), witness types, medical roles
- Lawyers: Opposing counsel, expert witness credentials, judicial contacts
- Paralegals: Case management contacts, filing locations, service addresses

Usage:
    >>> from src.vocabulary.role_profiles import StenographerProfile
    >>> profile = StenographerProfile()
    >>> role = profile.detect_person_role("Dr. Martinez", document_text)
    >>> print(role)  # "Treating physician"

To add a new profile:
    1. Create a new class inheriting from RoleDetectionProfile
    2. Define profession-specific pattern constants
    3. Implement detect_person_role() and detect_place_relevance()
    4. Import in vocabulary_extractor.py
