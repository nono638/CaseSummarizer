"""
System Resource Manager for LocalScribe.

Provides dynamic calculation of optimal worker counts based on available
system resources (CPU cores, RAM) and user-configurable resource usage
percentage.

The goal is to allow users to balance processing speed vs. system impact:
- 100%: Maximum speed, but computer may be slow during processing
- 75%: Good balance (recommended default)
- 50%: Moderate impact, computer remains responsive
- 25%: Minimal impact, processing takes longer

Usage:
    from src.system_resources import get_optimal_workers

    # For Case Briefing extraction (2GB per worker estimate)
    workers = get_optimal_workers(task_ram_gb=2.0)

    # For document extraction (0.5GB per worker estimate)
    workers = get_optimal_workers(task_ram_gb=0.5)
