Line Number Remover Preprocessor

Removes line numbers that appear in margins of legal transcripts.
Common in deposition transcripts and court filings.

Patterns handled:
- "1  ", "2  ", ..., "25  " at line start (transcript format)
- "  1", "  2", ..., "  25" at line end (some PDF exports)
- "|1", "|2", etc. (some legal document formats)

Does NOT remove:
- Numbers that are part of content (dates, case numbers, citations)
- Page numbers (handled by RawTextExtractor)

    Removes line numbers from legal transcript margins.

    Legal transcripts often have line numbers 1-25 in the left margin
    for reference during depositions. These add noise to AI summaries.

    Example input:
        1  Q.  Good morning, Mr. Smith.
        2  A.  Good morning.
        3  Q.  State your name for the record.

    Example output:
