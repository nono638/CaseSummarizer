# Changelog

All notable changes to CasePrepd will be documented in this file.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.35] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Two files with the same basename from different folders are now tracked independently in the file table — previously, removing one silently dropped the other from internal state while leaving the row visible
- Integrity check for the FAISS index now raises a clear `FileNotFoundError` when either `index.faiss` or `index.pkl` is missing, instead of silently computing a partial hash and surfacing later as a misleading "tampered" error
- Semantic excerpt selection no longer returns an arbitrary window when the question has zero or negative similarity to every candidate — falls back to a deterministic sentence-truncated excerpt so nonsense queries don't get confident-looking but irrelevant citations
- Worker subprocess rejects a second follow-up search while the first is still running, preventing two `SemanticOrchestrator` instances from loading the thread-unsafe sentencepiece tokenizer concurrently

### Changed
- Settings registry split: `settings_registry.py` (1671 lines) now a 239-line orchestrator that delegates to per-tab modules in `src/ui/settings/registry/` (appearance, vocabulary, preprocessing, corpus, search, export, logging_tab, advanced)
- Shared HTML construction extracted from `html_builder.py` and `combined_html_builder.py` into a new `html_fragments.py` module: vocab table toggles/headers/rows + Q&A item HTML now live in one place

### Removed
- Dead `SUMMARY_RESULT` / `MULTI_DOC_RESULT` / `META_SUMMARY_GENERATED` enum values and factory methods from `queue_messages.py` — leftovers from the removed Ollama summarization flow

### Added
- 12 regression tests covering the four robustness fixes (basename collision, integrity check, similarity floor, follow-up serialization)

## [1.0.34] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Stop button now disables during its confirmation modal so a panicked double-click no longer queues a duplicate prompt
- Stop button now cancels pending extraction/preprocessing retry callbacks — no more ghost re-extraction after a cancel
- Preprocessing-phase status updates ("Extracting…", "Cleaning headers…") now reach the status bar; they were previously dropped because the gate only checked vocabulary-phase activity
- Load More in the vocabulary panel now disables itself while loading so a second click can't silently no-op
- Drag-drop file payloads parsed via `tk.splitlist` (the standard tkinterdnd2 recipe) — paths with braces no longer mis-split
- CLI: `search.json` now writes whenever `--query` is given regardless of `--only` filter
- CLI: `vocabulary.json` no longer written when the vocabulary list is empty (matches the human-output behavior)
- CLI: `combined.docx` now embeds the key excerpts as the summary section, matching the GUI's combined export
- Silent `re.error` in transcript cleaner upgraded to `logger.warning`
- `QuestionEditDialog` import-time `NameError` (missing `pathlib.Path`) introduced by the BaseModalDialog refactor

### Changed
- Renamed `SemanticResult.is_answered` → `has_relevant_match`, `get_summary_tab_status` → `get_key_excerpts_tab_status`, and `_configure_qa_table_style` → `_configure_semantic_table_style` so names reflect the retrieval-only architecture
- `QuestionEditDialog` now inherits from `BaseModalDialog` like every other dialog (17 lines of manual setup removed)
- `FileReaders` per-format methods consolidated behind a `_wrap_reader` helper that owns shared logging, confidence, and error handling
- Stale docstrings/comments that described removed Coreference, QAConverter, and LLM-answer-generation flows rewritten or deleted

### Removed
- Dead `answer_mode` parameter chain (GUI → WorkerManager → worker subprocess → SemanticWorker → SemanticOrchestrator) — every consumer hard-coded "extraction"
- Dead `include_verification` / `include_verification_colors` parameter chain across the entire export stack
- `CoreferenceResolver` no-op stub and its package export
- Dead UI module `src/ui/pipeline_indicator.py` (instantiated but never displayed)
- Dead Ollama leftover `config/models.yaml` and the `MODEL_CONFIGS`/`load_model_configs()` block
- Orphan download scripts for removed features (`download_coref_model.py`, `download_hallucination_model.py`)
- `src.core.ai` import from `main.py` (package was emptied last release)
- Empty `data/keywords/` directory and its `.gitignore` rule
- Dead config constants (`LOG_FILE`, `LOG_FORMAT`, `LOG_DATE_FORMAT`, `DEBUG_DEFAULT_FILE`, `RESIZE_DEBOUNCE_MS`, `ERROR_DISPLAY_MAX_CHARS`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP_FRACTION`, `VOCAB_FEEDBACK_CSV`, `SPACY_THREAD_TIMEOUT_SEC`)
- Commented-out deprecated single-section vocab export shortcuts in `dynamic_output.py`
- Dead `_filter_sentences` function in `key_sentences.py`

### Added
- 74 new tests: `ExtractionResult` factories + dict access, `FileReaders._wrap_reader` paths, CLI helpers (`collect_inputs`, `drain`, `parse_args`, `write_json`/`write_human`, `run_query`), `worker_process._build_scorer_inputs`
- 22 regression tests for the bug-sweep fixes in `test_bug_sweep_2026_05.py`

### Infrastructure
- 12 existing tests hardened with content-verifying assertions (layout analyzer bounds, extraction error-state, name-dataset content, feedback ML singleton identity)
- `torch>=2.4,<3.0` and `transformers>=5.0,<6.0` pinned explicitly (previously transitive via sentence-transformers)
- `pandas>=2.0,<4` and `pyinstaller>=6.0` added to `requirements-dev.txt` for tests/scripts and build

## [1.0.33] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- `after()` callback leaks on window destroy — preprocessing and extraction retries now cancel pending callbacks via `_cancel_and_reschedule` helper
- Tooltip dismiss timer leaks in widgets and vocabulary treeview — prior dismiss ID is cancelled before scheduling a new one
- Follow-up search button now disables on empty/whitespace input (prevents no-op clicks)
- Clearer error when "Process Files" is clicked with no valid files ready — distinguishes no-files / still-preparing / all-failed cases
- Legacy docstrings and log messages referencing the obsolete scispaCy package updated to reference the bundled `en_ner_bc5cdr_md` model instead

### Changed
- Worker subprocess lifetime wrapped in a context manager with 4-layer shutdown defense (`__exit__`, atexit hook, main try/finally, `daemon=True` backstop) — no more orphaned workers on unexpected exit paths
- Worker process now sends result messages via `QueueMessage` factory methods consistently — eliminates raw-tuple DRY violations
- Tests refreshed to match the new button-state helper and reschedule indirection

### Added
- 91 new unit tests covering previously untested modules: `src/core/paths.py`, `SingletonHolder`, `logging_config` utilities, role profiles, corpus registry (delete/combine/list/exists/sanitize)
- 42 regression tests for the bug-sweep fixes: after-callback lifecycle, tooltip leaks, worker lifecycle, QueueMessage refactor, UI polish

### Infrastructure
- 18 existing shallow tests hardened with content-verifying assertions (replaced `is not None` / truthiness checks)

## [1.0.32] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Occurrence floor bypass now uses a user-configurable exception score (default 97) instead of a hard-coded value of 85
- Vocabulary settings panel no longer wastes 200px of vertical space when the corpus warning banner is hidden
- Missing `VOCABULARY_OCCURRENCE_EXCEPTION_SCORE` import in vocabulary_extractor.py causing NameError at runtime

### Added
- Exception score setting in Vocabulary tab, visually paired with the occurrence floor setting for discoverability

## [1.0.31] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Settings changes (relevance thresholds, citation limits) now take effect immediately without restarting the app
- Removed duplicate search input from result panels — one search bar, no confusion
- Transcript detection now samples first and middle of document, catching transcripts with long preambles (previously limited to first 20K characters)
- Combined export dropdown now includes Word (.docx) option that was missing despite backend support
- Config file paths centralized via src/core/paths.py — eliminates fragile __file__-based path chains in 9 files

### Changed
- Renamed internal `_d()` config function to `_frozen_setting()` / `get_live_setting()` for clarity
- find_violations.py now enforces centralized path resolution (flags __file__-based config paths)

### Infrastructure
- New src/core/paths.py: single source of truth for config/data/assets directory resolution
- 7 new transcript boundary tests covering all document size categories

## [1.0.30] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Stop button now resets all pending flags (_key_sentences_pending, _followup_pending), preventing infinite poll loops and blocked follow-up searches after cancellation
- Clear Files shows status message when blocked during processing instead of failing silently
- Follow-up status bar displays citation length instead of always-zero quick_answer length
- Search cancellation correctly logged as user action, not misreported as indexing failure
- Default questions loaded from single source (DefaultQuestionsManager) instead of dual YAML/JSON paths
- ask_question() return type annotation corrected to SemanticResult
- Silent exception handlers in export dropdowns now log errors instead of bare pass
- "Key Sentences" → "Key Excerpts" in README and Help dialog
- 26 pre-existing test failures repaired (stale imports of removed constants and parameters)

### Changed
- Workers split into individual modules: processing_worker.py, semantic_worker.py, progressive_extraction_worker.py (workers.py is now a re-export shim)
- Stale LLM/answer-generation references updated across 12 docstrings and comments
- CSV export no longer includes empty "Quick Answer" column
- HTML export omits empty Answer div when quick_answer is blank

### Removed
- Dead code: REJECTION_TEXT, hallucination verification branch (70 lines), chunk_pdf(), _paragraph_chunk(), 12 dead config constants (summary, license, BM25_WEIGHT, RERANKER_TOP_K)
- pypdf dependency (only consumer was deleted chunk_pdf method)
- Dead data/keywords directory reference from spec and asset audit
- Deleted test for removed token_budget module and chunking_config.yaml

### Infrastructure
- 18 new tests covering CSV export columns, HTML quick_answer guard, cancellation vs failure, default questions routing, type annotations
- 5 existing tests hardened with real behavioral assertions and boundary edge cases
- Suite: 3760 passed, 10 skipped, 1 xfailed

## [1.0.29] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Single-chunk retrieval: semantic search now returns only the top-1 reranked chunk instead of assembling multiple chunks — eliminates wasted computation and relevance score dilution
- Adaptive retrieval k: candidate pool scales with corpus size (small documents retrieve fewer candidates); config value is ceiling, not fixed target
- Dynamic mean-cutoff reranking: cross-encoder reranker keeps only chunks above the mean score (capped at top_k) instead of always returning a fixed count

### Fixed
- Score explainer crash when feature count changed (mock feature vector size mismatch)
- Export All stub key mismatch ("Summary" → "Key Excerpts") causing empty summary in Word/PDF exports
- Build readiness test missing gibberish_detector hidden imports
- Feature vector size assertions updated from 53 to 55

### Infrastructure
- 10 new test files covering export modules, header/footer remover, export service, semantic orchestrator, hybrid retriever (~170 new tests)
- Deprecated multi-chunk context assembly code moved to src/deprecated/
- Chunk-level progress during semantic indexing

## [1.0.28] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Key excerpts ranked by interestingness score (vocab hits, person entities, word rarity, rejected term penalty, gibberish penalty) — most useful excerpts now sort to the top
- Markov chain gibberish detection with spell-checker fallback for vocabulary filtering
- ftfy text cleaning for OCR artifacts and encoding issues
- Normalized gibberish scores as ML features (worst + mean per term)

### Fixed
- Export (HTML/PDF/Word) was missing key excerpts due to wrong output key lookup
- Raised Markov gibberish hard-filter threshold from 4.0 to 5.5 to reduce false positives

### Infrastructure
- GitHub Pages version auto-updates during rebuild

## [1.0.27] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

## [1.0.24] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Semantic search failing on end-user machines — nomic embedding model's custom architecture code (`trust_remote_code`) was not bundled, causing offline loading to fail with "couldn't connect to huggingface.co"

### Infrastructure
- Bundle nomic-bert custom Python code (`configuration_hf_nomic_bert.py`, `modeling_hf_nomic_bert.py`) with patched `config.json` for fully offline model loading
- Download scripts auto-fetch and patch custom code after model download
- `validate_models.py` now requires custom code files, failing early if missing
- 21 new tests for offline model readiness and custom code bundling

## [1.0.23] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Embedding model no longer attempts HuggingFace downloads — `local_files_only=True` enforced unconditionally
- Dev mode now mirrors production exactly: all assets load from project directory, not system fallbacks
- NLTK restricted to single bundled path (no system corpus fallback)
- Tiktoken and HuggingFace cache env vars force-set instead of setdefault

### Added
- Asset audit log at startup — every model, dataset, and binary logged with BUNDLED/SYSTEM/MISSING provenance
- Pre-build validation script (`scripts/validate_models.py`) catches missing or truncated assets before PyInstaller

### Infrastructure
- Frozen-mode guards on all spaCy and ML model loading — RuntimeError with reinstall guidance instead of silent fallback

## [1.0.22] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Vocabulary quality indicator turns yellowish-green when some algorithms fail, showing users results may be incomplete

### Fixed
- Graceful degradation when individual vocabulary algorithms or semantic questions fail — partial results shown instead of crash
- Bundled app no longer falls back to system Python dependencies at runtime
- Missing psutil dependency added to build
- Remaining user-facing error messages cleaned up (no raw tracebacks)

### Infrastructure
- Test gap audit: strengthened 40+ weak/tautological assertions across 22 existing test files
- 9 new edge case test files covering vocabulary extractor, chunker, worker process, worker manager, hybrid retriever, PDF extractor, file_utils, status_reporter, and citation_excerpt
- Net +316 tests (3,078 → 3,394)

## [1.0.21] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Fixed "Resource punkt not found" error on end-user machines — RAKE now uses bundled nupunkt sentence splitter instead of NLTK punkt data
- Bundled tiktoken BPE encoding data so token counting works offline without internet
- Improved error messages when bundled spaCy models are missing — users now see reinstall guidance instead of cryptic OSError tracebacks

### Removed
- Removed punkt_tab from NLTK data bundle (no longer needed, saves disk space)

### Infrastructure
- Full audit of system dependencies to ensure standalone installer has zero runtime downloads
- Added tests for tiktoken offline loading and bundled cache validation
- model_loader now logs a warning (not silent debug) when falling back from bundled to HuggingFace

## [1.0.20] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Crash in corpus dialog when clicking an empty treeview row
- Crash in model import when backup file already deleted (`missing_ok=True`)
- Import rule violation: `semantic_question_editor` now imports from `src.config` instead of `src.core.config`
- Semantic index wait status showing "0m elapsed" instead of "30s elapsed"
- Cancellation during semantic indexing now gives the thread a 5-second grace period

### Added
- 99 new tests covering critical gaps identified in test audit:
  - Worker execute() methods (ProcessingWorker, SemanticWorker, ProgressiveExtractionWorker)
