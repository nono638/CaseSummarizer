Indication: This patient presented with progressive left-sided radiating fow back pain that extends down his left
poolesfor leg. He also enderses left leg numbness. MRI 1.umber Spine 7/t3/21 demonstrates a large disc
hemiation at L3/4. The dsks, benefilm, and attematives to the proposed procedum were explained to the patient
by Dr. Arthur Jenkins in their office, and all questions were answered to their satisfaction.
Description of Procedure:
Af1er the patient was brought to the opera8ng mom and af1er adequate Bnes were placed, the patient
positkmed hinsellin the prone position on the Wilson frame of the Jackson Table. Sedation was induced, and
the Interal 8uoro was bmught into the field, and the lateral aspect of the facet joint and the transverse process
of I.3/4 were identified in AP and lateral fluoro.
The back area was then carefuny washed, and then prepped and draped in the usual stedle fashion. A
"Time-Out"was perfomied, and critical steps ueviewed. The Incision was Infiltrated with Marcaine with
The initial incision was made with a #15 blade. A Bowie tip foGowed the lamina and facet joint on that side, and
the endoscope was placed, but immediately we encountered bleeding that did not slop, even though Itwas not
much in volume, it made visibilty poor. We instead then placed a 5.3 mm dilator, and then a 9.4 mmdAntor was
then placed over the 5.3 mm dilator, and in a subperiosleal fashion, the Inseations of the multifidus muscle onto
the interior edge of the lamina of the top level, and the medial aspect of the target facet joint were removed In a
blunt fashion. The larger METRx dAstors were then used so a 14x4 cm tubular retractor was placed.
This was then secured using the clamp onto the Jackson table with the METRx flexible arm assernbly. The
fluoro unit was used to demonstrate that this was on an equivalent paranel trajectmy into the disk space of
t.3/4. the remaining multifidus muscle that was dhectly between the region for the laminatomy and in the
viewer's way was bipolared and removed using a pituitary rangeur. At this point, the region where the lateral
foramenolomy would be performed was well-visualized, with IIgamentum flavum seen medial to the facet joint,
and the Inferior edge of the top lamina, superior edge of the lower lamina, and the medial aspect of the facet aA
within the field.
The remaining multifidus and longlesimus muscle that were direcUy between the region for the forananctomy
and in the viewer's way were bipolared and removed using a pitullary rangeur. At this point, Su :egion where
the Interal aspect of the foramenolomy would be perkmned was well-visualized, wilh the L4 transverse process
of the fewer level, and the supegfor articular pmcess of L4 arising from this over Kambin's triangle.
At this point, the lateral aspect of the ascending facet of IA was undercut with a combination of the drill and the
2mm and3mm Kerrison rangeurs. The inter tansverse ligaments was detached fmm the side of the facet,
exposing the radicular artery and the dorsal ramus LS, which led to the nerve root of L3. Once this root was
able to be klentitled, and foBowed to the pedicle of L3 under the pars of L3, the lateral aspect of the thecal sao

was seen just posterior to the vertebral body of LS.
The LS mot was imed of adherent soar, and retracted lateraBy to expose the hemiated disk fragment
undemeath. The pedicle of 1.3 was palpated, and the fateral aspect of the facet joint of L3/4 was identified ,
which made up the dorsal and caudal merges of the neural foramen. The disk fragment was then removed in a
piecemeal fashion, with care to pmtect the mot at LS/4 as well as the lateral aspect of the thecal sac. After
extensive removal of the fragment, using up and down curets, pituitary rangeurs, and the right-angled nonre
hook, the root and forainen were felt to be free and no longer pressed upon by the disk fragment.
Adequate hemostasis was obtained with the bipolar cautory and bone wax on the bony edges, The wound was
Irrigated with a liter of antibiotk>containing saline., A thin layer of Evacel fibrin glue was sprayed on the dorsal
surface of the dura and nerve root for homos1asis and neural prolection. The fascla was closed with 0-Vicryl
sutute, the subcuticular layer closed with Interrupted inverted 3-0 Vicsyl sulule, and the sidn closed with 2
layers of Dormabond and a Tegaderm dressing. The patelnt was aroused fem sedation, and moved to the
